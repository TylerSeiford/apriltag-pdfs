# AprilTag PDFs

This repository contains pre-generated PDFs of [AprilTag 3][apriltags] tags. Currently available tags are from the `tag36h11` and `tag16h5` families, in sizes of 100mm, 200mm, and 8in, in US Letter and A4 paper sizes.

## Generation

The tags were converted from PNG source files from the [apriltag-imgs][] repository using ImageMagick. Thanks to @cbteeple for initially developing the technique.

To reproduce these files you may need to [modify the ImageMagick security policy][policy] to allow writing PDFs.

The following command creates 300dpi, 8.5 x 11in (US Letter) PDF. The 10-pixel wide tag is scaled to be 200mm. (The constant 25.4 is the conversion factor from inches to mm.) It also adds a thin border around the tag and writes some reference information 0.25in from the bottom of the page; these features can be omitted by deleting the corresponding lines.

For A4-sized PDFs, a density of 120 dots per cm is used.

The `15h6.sh` script was used to generate 8 inch 16h5 tags.
